# ðŸ“± Mobile App API Integration - Final Requirements

## Project Overview
- **Web App (React)**: âœ… Ready with APIs integrated
- **Mobile App (React Native)**: âœ… Static app ready, needs API integration
- **Backend**: Existing APIs for web frontend working perfectly

## 1. Mobile App Authentication Method
- **Login Method**: Mobile Number + OTP (6-digit)
- **OTP Service**: Twilio SMS (or specify alternative)
- **OTP Expiry**: 5 minutes (or specify duration)
- **Token**: JWT tokens for session management
- **No Password**: Members don't have passwords

## 2. Member Registration Process
- **Self-Registration**: Members can register themselves through mobile app
- **Required Fields**: 
  - Name
  - Mobile Number
  - Business Name
  - Business Type (sound, decorator, catering, generator, madap, light)
  - City
  - Pincode
  - Association Name
- **Optional Fields**: Email, Profile Image

## 3. Mobile App Features Confirmation
Please confirm which features you have in your static app:

- [ ] **Member Login** (Mobile + OTP)
- [ ] **Member Directory** (Browse other members)
- [ ] **Member Search** (Search by name/business type)
- [ ] **Member Profile View** (View other member details)
- [ ] **My Profile** (View/edit own profile)
- [ ] **Events List** (View upcoming events)
- [ ] **Event Details** (View specific event)
- [ ] **Association Info** (View association details)
- [ ] **Board of Directors** (View BOD members)
- [ ] **Profile Photo Upload** (Upload profile image)
- [ ] **Other features** (specify)

  "city": "string (required)",
  "pincode": "string (required, 6 digits)",
  "state": "string (default: Maharashtra)",
  "associationName": "string (required)",
  "profileImage": "string (optional)",
  "email": "string (optional)",
  "isActive": "boolean (default: true)",
  "isMobileVerified": "boolean (default: false)",
  "paymentStatus": "enum: Paid|Pending|Overdue|Not Required",
  "createdAt": "date",
  "updatedAt": "date"
}
```

### OTP Model
```javascript
{
  "_id": "string",

### Middleware
```
middleware/
â””â”€â”€ mobileAuthMiddleware.js  # Mobile-specific authentication
```

## 9. Environment Variables to Add

```bash
# SMS Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-twilio-account-sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-twilio-auth-token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890

OTP_MAX_ATTEMPTS=3
OTP_RATE_LIMIT_MINUTES=15
```

## 10. Implementation Priority

4. Test OTP flow

### Phase 2: Basic Features
1. Member profile management
2. Member directory browsing
3. Event viewing
4. File upload functionality

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Search and filtering
2. Association and BOD information
3. Error handling and validation
4. Performance optimization

## 11. Questions to Confirm

### A. SMS Service
- [ ] Do you have Twilio account/credentials?
- [ ] Or should I set up a different SMS service?
- [ ] Should I include WhatsApp API as well?

### B. Member Features
- [ ] What member information do you display in your mobile app?
- [ ] What fields can members edit in their profile?
- [ ] Do you need member contact functionality?

### C. Event Features
- [ ] Do you need RSVP functionality for events?
- [ ] Should members be able to create events or only view them?
- [ ] Do you need event notifications?

### D. File Upload
- [ ] Do you have image upload in your mobile app?
- [ ] What's the maximum file size you want to support?
- [ ] Do you need image compression?

## 12. Ready to Proceed?

If you confirm the above requirements, I can start building the mobile APIs immediately with these assumptions:

âœ… **Authentication**: Mobile number + OTP (6-digit, 5-minute expiry)
âœ… **SMS Service**: Twilio (with setup instructions)
âœ… **Member Registration**: Self-registration through mobile app
âœ… **Core Features**: Member directory, events, profile management
âœ… **File Upload**: Profile photo upload (5MB limit)

## 13. Key Benefits

- **No Impact**: Existing web APIs remain completely untouched
- **Separate System**: Mobile APIs work independently
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new mobile features
- **Secure**: JWT-based authentication with OTP verification
- **Flexible**: Easy to modify without affecting web frontend

**Next Steps**: Confirm the requirements above and I'll start building the mobile APIs for your React Native app!
