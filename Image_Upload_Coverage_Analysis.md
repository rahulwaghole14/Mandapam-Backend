## 📊 **Database Model Analysis**

### **Models with Image Fields:**
| Model | Image Fields | Current Status |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Member** | `profileImage`, `businessImages` | ✅ **Fields exist** |
| **Association** | `logo` | ✅ **Field exists** |
| **Event** | `image` | ✅ **Field exists** |
| **BOD** | `profileImage` | ✅ **Field exists** |
| **Vendor** | No image fields | ❌ **Missing fields** |
| **Gallery** | `filename` | ✅ **Field exists** |

### **Models Needing Image Fields:**
- **Vendor** - Needs `profileImage` and `businessImages` fields

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Requirements**

### **1. Multer Configuration Updates:**
- ✅ **Profile Image Upload** - Already configured
- ✅ **Business Images Upload** - Already configured
- ✅ **Logo Upload** - Need to add
- ✅ **Event Images Upload** - Already configured

### **2. Route Updates Needed:**
- **Member Routes** - Add multer middleware to create/update endpoints
- **Association Routes** - Add multer middleware to create/update endpoints
- **BOD Routes** - Add multer middleware to create/update endpoints
- **Vendor Routes** - Add multer middleware and image fields
- **Event Routes** - Add multer middleware to create/update endpoints

### **3. Database Updates Needed:**
- **Vendor Model** - Add `profileImage` and `businessImages` fields
- **Migration Script** - Add image fields to vendors table

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Implement missing image upload functionality** in all APIs
2. **Add image fields to Vendor model** and create migration
3. **Update all create/update endpoints** with multer middleware
4. **Test image upload functionality** across all APIs
5. **Update API documentation** with image upload examples

---

**Current Status**: ❌ **INCOMPLETE** - Only 28% of APIs have image upload functionality  
**Required Action**: 🚀 **IMPLEMENT** - Add image upload to remaining 72% of APIs  
**Estimated Effort**: 📅 **2-3 hours** - To implement all missing functionality
